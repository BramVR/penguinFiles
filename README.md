# Penguin Species Prediction in Maya

This repository contains the required files for the "Neural Net in Maya" tutorial available on [this website](https://bvr.pages.dev/posts/neural_net_in_maya/).

## Contents

- **Dataset**: Located in the `dataset` folder, the file `penguins-clean-all.csv` is derived from the Palmer Penguins dataset. It contains measurements for three penguin species: bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass.
  
- **Maya Rig**: Inside the `rig` folder, you'll find `penguin.ma`. It's a rigged Maya model of a penguin. This rig allows users to adjust specific attributes of the penguin, such as flipper length, bill length, bill depth, weight, and size. Using these attributes, the provided Python script predicts which of the three penguin species the model most closely resembles.
